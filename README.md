# News and Video Aggregator
The project comprises a REST API developed with the Java SpringBoot framework, complemented by a website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary objective of the API is to fetch news articles and videos from the internet, leveraging the capabilities of the NewsAPI and Youtube API. The REST API has two routes: ‘video’ and ‘news’ each of which have one parameter ‘category’ which can be used to customize the content returned from the route.To present this information in a user-friendly manner, we have designed an accompanying website which users can also use to customize the content retrieved from our API.
